<h2>Effects and Goals</h2>
  <p>I really need something else to focus on other than work, computer gaems, and kids. So after everthing happened i decided to try to go back to school and see how that worked out.
Time management is/and was poor. So now i can focus on school and kids. Alos wish i could learn more about tech to be able to stream properly </p>
